To update your GitHub branch with your local changes, follow these steps:
Commit your local changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

Push your changes to the remote branch:

git push origin <your-branch-name>

If your local branch is behind the remote branch, you may need to pull the latest changes first:
Fetch the latest changes:

git fetch origin

Merge the changes into your local branch:

git merge origin/<your-branch-name>

Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.
Push your updated branch to GitHub:

git push origin <your-branch-name>




To update the main branch with your changes, follow these steps:

Switch to the main branch:

git checkout main

Ensure your main branch is up-to-date:

git pull origin main

Merge your branch into main:

git merge your-branch-name

Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:

git push origin main

If there are any conflicts during the merge, you'll need to resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, add the resolved files and commit the changes
